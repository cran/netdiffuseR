The Korean Family Planning data were
stored on a Vax tape that Rogers had given to Marc Granovetter who then gave
it to his colleague Roland Soong (see Granovetter & Soong, 1983).  Granovetter
instructed Song to send the tape to me and I had it loaded on the Vax machine
at USC in 1990 and was able to download the data to a PC. The first two datasets
were acquired for my dissertation (Valente, 1991) and the third added as I
completed my book on Network Models of the Diffusion of Innovations (Valente,
1995; also see Valente, 2005).

\description{
From Valente (1995) \dQuote{Scholars at Seoul National University's School
of Public Health (Park, Chung, Han & Lee, 1974) collected data on the
adoption of family planning methods among all married women of child-bearing
age 25 in Korea villages in 1973 (N = 1,047).}
}
\details{
The dataset has 1,047 respondents (women) from 25 communities. Collected
during 1973 it spans 11 years of data.
