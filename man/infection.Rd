\description{
Calculates infectiousness and susceptibility for each node in the graph
}
\details{
Normalization, \code{normalize=TRUE}, is applied by dividing the
resulting number from the infectiousness/susceptibility stat
by the number of individuals who adopted the innovation at
time \eqn{t}.

Given that node \eqn{i} adopted the innovation in time \eqn{t}, its
Susceptibility is calculated as follows

\deqn{S_i = \frac{%
\sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij(t-k+1)}z_{j(t-k)}\times \frac{1}{w_k}}{%
\sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij(t-k+1)}z_{j(1\leq t \leq t-k)} \times \frac{1}{w_k} }\qquad \mbox{for }i,j=1,\dots,n\quad i\neq j}{%
S(i) = [\sum_k \sum_j (x(ij,t-k+1) * z(j,t-k))/w(k)]/[\sum_k \sum_j (x(ij,t-k+1) * z(j, 1<=t<=t-k))/w(k)]  for  j != i}

where \eqn{x_{ij(t-k+1)}}{x(ij,t-k+1)} is 1 whenever there's a link from \eqn{i}
to \eqn{j} at time \eqn{t-k+1}, \eqn{z_{j(t-k)}}{z(j,t-k)}
is 1 whenever individual \eqn{j} adopted the innovation at time \eqn{t-k},
\eqn{z_{j(1\leq t \leq t-k)}}{z(j, 1<=t<=t-k)} is 1 whenever
\eqn{j} had adopted the innovation up to \eqn{t-k}, and \eqn{w_k}{w(k)} is
the discount rate used (see below).

Similarly, infectiousness is calculated as follows

\deqn{I_i = \frac{%
\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{j=1}^n x_{ji(t+k-1)}z_{j(t+k)}\times \frac{1}{w_k}}{%
\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{j=1}^n x_{ji(t+k-1)}z_{j(t+k\leq t \leq T)}\times \frac{1}{w_k} }\qquad \mbox{for }i,j=1,\dots,n\quad i\neq j}{%
I(i) = [\sum_k \sum_j (x(ji,t) * z(j,t+1))/w(k)]/[\sum_k \sum_j (x(ji,t) * z(j, t+1<=t<=T))/w(k)]   for  j != i}

It is worth noticing that, as we can see in the formulas, while susceptibility
is from alter to ego, infection is from ego to alter.

When \code{outgoing=FALSE} the algorithms are based on incoming edges, this is
the adjacency matrices are transposed swapping the indexes \eqn{(i,j)} by
\eqn{(j,i)}. This can be useful for some users.

Finally, by default both are normalized by the number of individuals who
adopted the innovation in time \eqn{t-k}. Thus, the resulting formulas,
when \code{normalize=TRUE}, can be rewritten as

\deqn{%
S_i' = \frac{S_i}{\sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{j=1}^nz_{j(t-k)}\times \frac{1}{w_k}} %
\qquad I_i' = \frac{I_i}{\sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{j=1}^nz_{j(t-k)} \times\frac{1}{w_k}}}{%
S(i)' = S(i)/[\sum_k \sum_j z(j,t-k)/w(k)]

I(i)' = I(i)/[\sum_k \sum_j z(j,t-k)/w(k)]}

For more details on these measurements, please refer to the vignette titled
\emph{Time Discounted Infection and Susceptibility}.

\section{Discount rate}{


Discount rate, \eqn{w_k}{w(k)} in the formulas above, can be either exponential
or linear. When \code{expdiscount=TRUE}, \eqn{w_k = (1 + r)^{k-1}}{w(k) = (1+r)^(k-1)}, otherwise
it will be \eqn{w_k = k}{w(k)=k}.

Note that when \eqn{K=1}, the above formulas are equal to the ones presented
in Valente et al. (2015).
