#' Network Analysis for Diffusion of Innovations
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Statistical analysis, visualization and simulation of network diffusion of
#' innovations. The package implements algorithms for
#' calculating stats such as innovation threshold levels, infectiousness
#' (contagion) and susceptibility, and hazard rates as presented in Burt (1987),
#' Valente (1995), and Myers (2000) (among others).
